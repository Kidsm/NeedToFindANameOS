# NeedToFindANameOS

I decided to enter the Limine master-race and create an OS using it. It will be 64bit I guess because x86 is considered a sin

I don't know how this project will end (hopefully with something working) but here are some goals which are somewhat sane

1: Keyboard, Mouse and Sound drivers (at least) <br />
2: Working shell (no shit) <br />
3: some advance type of multi-processing, gotta decide what though <br />
4: graphics (hopefully something that isn't 16bit colors and looks like a toddler's magnum opus) <br />
5: If my little brain will not die in the process a file system will be cool <br />

For whoever finds this repository, you can steal the code if you want, enjoy.
